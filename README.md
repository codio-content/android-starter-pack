The project contains default empty android project created with Android Studio and uploaded as zip to Codio.

file `local.properties` should be updated to the right SDK path

```
sdk.dir=/home/codio/Android/Sdk
```

to compile the app type in the Terminal in `~/workspace` folder
```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

2 emulators are available `codio` x86_64 and `codio2` arm7, but neighter doesn't seem is working good.
